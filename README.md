# Alacrity
A 2d game involving a 2 person battle in space.
Each player controlls a certain number of ships and can group them into fleets of ships for greater firepower/protection at the cost of mobility
Each ship is unique and has certain traits that differentiate it from other ships
Atm the game is 1 player vs tha AI, I plan to eventually have multiplayer support
The game is Real Time Strategy and is relatively fast paced, I want to make it a bit slower than it is now to account for more stategy.
